# Bad Apple
A series of crates that I made to compile images/video into asciinema & play them.<br>
The end goal is to make a kernel & legacy bootloader that together play bad apple.

## Crates
- **asciic**: An asciinema compiler.
- **asciild**: A procedural macro to link frames generated by [asciic](asciic/) on a Rust project.
- **asciix**: The asciinema player for frames generated with [asciic](asciic/).
